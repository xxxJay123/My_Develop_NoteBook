![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJTRg2JF2.png)

- As a Java developer, you have to download JDK (Java Development Kit) for Java Application Development. We will further explore JDK/ JRE/ JVM later on. Let's start the installation first.
- Let's use JDK 17 (not 18), which is a LTS version (Long Term Support).
- If you have installed JDK before, but not version 17 or not in Linux env, please still proceed this section.
  Based on your laptop specification, choose the corresponding JDK version to download.
  [Zulu Java 17 (WIndows OS)](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts&os=windows&package=jdk#zulu) Please check 64-bit or 32-bit.
  ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByPlz3yF2.png)

Place the unzipped package on your preferred path.
For example,==C:\software\zulu17.36.17-ca-jdk17.0.4.1-win_x64==
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJB-G3yFn.png)

- Setup %PATH% & %JAVA_HOME%
  Go to "System enviroment variables" in the control panel ，（編輯系統環境變數）

- Create your own Github Account [ignore if you have created before].
- Update your github account info (https://hackmd.io/0L9QRERCSWSmeTEiIt4Q3w)
- It is a well known open source repository for sharing idea/ projects among the developers' community. You will find lots of useful projects/materials in github during your life as a developer. Over 80 million developers are using github as of 2022.
- You should store or backup your own projects/ material/ documents by github, so that you can refer to it in the future easily.
- Vincent's github profile - You can follow me (Star my repositories)

### 4.3 Setup SSH key

Generate ssh key - from github (Reference, or follow the steps below)

1. Open Git Bash
2. Generate ssh key

```
# Type this command to generate ssh key. The ssh key will be located in your laptop C:/Users/XXXX/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

**[if fail in Step 2]** If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:

```
# only execute when you cannot success execute ED25519
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

3. ==**[Just Enter]**== You will find "Enter a file in which to save the key", please press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

```

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hkz1Hn1th.png)

### Part 3: Maven

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJ1lrn1Y3.png)

- Project management and comprehension tool that provides developers a complete build lifecycle framework.
- Development teams can automate the project's "build" infrastructure in almost no time as Maven uses a standard directory layout and a default build lifecycle.
- You will learn and use it when developing a Java & Springboot application.
  5.1 Install Maven 3
  [Offical Maven Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (as of 2023.06.30, should be version 3.9.3. For Maven, fine to get the latest version.
  ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyRTS2yY3.png)

- No installation process, extract the Maven archive to a directory of your choice once the download is complete. For example, C:\software\apache-maven-3.8.6
  ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyNCShJt2.png)

### 5.2 Add MAVEN_HOME System Variable

1. Open the Start menu and search for [environment variables](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/windows-set-environment-variable).
2. Click **Edit the system environment variables** result.
   ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyimI31Kn.png)

- Click the **New** button under the System variables section to add a new system environment variable.

  ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1bK82kY2.png)

- Click the **New** button in the Edit environment variable window.
  ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bkw98n1Y2.png)

- Enter **%MAVEN_HOME%\bin** in the new field. Click **OK** to save changes to the **Path** variable.
  ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJCc8hyth.png)

- Click **OK** in the Environment Variables window to save the changes to the system variables
  ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1ShI2yY3.png)

[Result Check]

- Check maven version
  - "Java version" should be the current java version
  - "Runtime path" should be same as java_home
  - Maven home should be same as %MAVEN_HOME%

```
mvn -v
```

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJvTL2kt3.png)

- You may check %MAVEN_HOME% and %PATH% as well, which are just set by you.
  ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk3pI2kFh.png)

### Part 4: Visual Studio Code

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkN083JKh.png)

- **We will use VSCode to code your Java & Springboot programs in the coming weeks!**
- Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.
- If you have programming background and want to use "IntelliJ IDEA" instead of VSCode, it's fine, just an IDE. But I would still recommend you to try VSCode, and feel how lightweight it is.
  6.1 Install VSCode from Official Site
- Install VScode in Windows OS directly, you can still use VSCode in Ubuntu Env.
  [VScode Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - Choose Windows, **Choose other system type if needed (64-bit / 32-bit)**
  ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryMGP31Yn.png)

- After downloading and unzipping, start the installation.
  ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJvGw2yK2.png)

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hyg7XpA_h.png)
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByxX7p0_3.png)
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJl7XT0u2.png)

### [Result Check]

- After reboot, you should see the path is updated.
- If no, set the VSCode installed path to $PATH (System Env Variable). After that, you can use command `code .` to launch VScode.
- Double check your VSCode installed path

```
C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\bin
```

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkUozLxqh.png)

Next time, you can simply type

```
code .
```

to open VSCode app in a project folder.
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJRO_3yth.png)

### 6.2 Extensions

- Explorer / Search / Extensions are common functions in VScode. Put it in the menu bar on the left hand side of VSCode.
  ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkqmFhkYh.png)

- **Extensions** in VSCode help it become an integrated IDE with powerful functions, like color themes/ syntax management/ icon setting/ text color for different file types. All of those features enable you to code much more easily in VSCode.
  ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1gVY2yF3.png)

You can install all of the extensions below:

- ==Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat==
- ==Extension Pack for Java (Install this, the other 4 Java extensions will be installed automatically)==
- ==Maven for Java==
- ==Debugger for Java==
- ==Project Manager for Java==
- ==Test Runner for Java==
- ==Ayu - file/folder logo==
- ==One Dark Pro - themes (One Dark Pro Darker)==
- ==Spring Initializer Java Support==
- ==Spring Boot Tools==
- ==Spring Boot Dashboard==
- ==Lombok Annotations Support for VS Code==
- ==XML==
- ==YAML==
- ==SQL Beautify==
- ==Dependency Analytics==
- ==Markdown Preview Enhanced==
- ==Prettier - Code formatter==

### 6.3 Code Formatter/ settings.json/ key shortcut

#### Step 1: VSCode general setting - settings.json

- In VSCode, press

```
shift+crtl+p
```

type **"open user settings json"** and select **"Open User Settings(JSON)"**.

- Overwrite your

```
settings.json
```

by [settings.json](https://github.com/hk-java/laptop-setup/blob/main/vscode/setting/windows/settings.json) in github/hk-java.
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1g8j31F3.png)

### [Result]

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyU8j3kY2.png)

### Step 2: VSCode Code Formatter - googlestyle.xml

CodeFormatter helps you auto-format your code to align the maven checkstyle/pmd plugin.

- From github laptop-setup, download the [googlestyle.xml](https://github.com/hk-java/laptop-setup/blob/main/vscode/code-formatter/java/googlestyle.xml) into a local folder **[you can choose your own folder to store the "googlestyle.xml"]**

```
# For example, I download it to here.
C:\vscode\java\googlestyle.xml
```

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1ty33yFh.png)

- **In VSCode**,

```
shift+crtl+p
```

, type "open settings json" and select **"Open User Settings(JSON)"**.

- Double check the path value is "**C:\\\vscode\\\java\\\googlestyle.xml**" in **"java.format.settings.url"**
- ==For Windows, you have to use double slash \\ to represent the value of \ in json.==

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkFMeIl92.png)

- Doublecheck **"lineSplit"** to **80** and **"comment.line_length"** to **200**.
  ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkCQhn1Fh.png)

#### Step 3: VSCode keyboard shortcut - keybindings.json

- **In VSCode**,

```
shift+crtl+p
```

type **"keyboard shortcuts json"** & select **"Open Keyboard Shortcut(JSON)"**
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByBqh3yKh.png)

- You can find the setup file for "Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)" in github [keybindings.json](https://github.com/hk-java/laptop-setup/blob/main/vscode/keyboard-shortcut/windows/keybindings.json)
- **Overwrite** the wholte file content to the above keybindings.json file in vscode.
- These are the shortcuts that you would frequently use:
  ```
  - shift+crtl+f: Auto format the code
  - shift+crtl+o: Organize java Imports, remove unused Imports
  - shift+crtl+k: Restart VSCode
  ```

### [Result]

- To let the above configurations take effect, you have to **restart the VSCode (you can just shift+crtl+k)**
